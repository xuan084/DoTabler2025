HgO, after passivation, current density increased over 10 times—methanol oxidation  It was found that the greater the pH the faster the nanostructures grow, and the greater the Cu(OH)»2 to CuO ratio; for the samples obtained in the highest pH, the highest value of methanol oxidation current density oxidation was registered—methanol oxidation  It was found that selectivity towards ethylene formation is much greater than for the plain foil, accompanied by great stability—electrochemical CO» reduction into ethylene  Cu was electrochemically oxidized at various operating conditions. It was found that the greater the electrolyte concentration, the greater the ECSA (electrochemical surface area) and the higher the current densities recorded during the carbon dioxide reduction reaction—electrochemical CO, reduction  Performance of electrochemically grown nanostructures vs. plain copper plate in carbon dioxide reduction into formic acid, methane, and ethene was compared: it was shown that selectivity toward carbon on low-oxidation-state products is much better for the electrochemically grown nanostructures, even after 9 h of reaction—electrochemical CO> reduction  Electrochemically grown copper oxides served in Gas Diffusion Electrodes (GDE) as an active material for CO» reduction; scalable technology has been reported; selectivity to C5, products was as high as 87%—electrochemical CO, reduction  Photocorrosion performance of catalysts for Hz generation: CuOx nanostructures were coated with carbonized glucose, which improved stability—hydrogen generation (water splitting)  Various electrolytes were applied: 0.1% NH4F in ethylene glycol with 10%, 5% HO, or 1% H2O0 with 0.1 M KOH or 0.1 M NaOH. The greater the water content in the electrolyte, the longer the nanoneedles. Methylene blue (MB) was subjected  to photodegradation on the formed materials; the longer nanoneedles composed of both CuzO and CuO were found to provide the highest degradation efficiency, equal to 88%  Reference  [82]  [83]  [84]  [85]  [86]  [87]  [89] \f"

Initial Conditions:  - The red block is clear  - The yellow block is clear  - The hand is empty  - The orange block is on top of the blue block  - The yellow block is on top of the orange block - The red block is on the table  - The blue block is on the table  So the initial configuration is: yellow  orange  blue red  table table  hhh  Goal:  - The red block is on top of the blue block  - The orange block is on top of the yellow block - The yellow block is on top of the red block  So the goal configuration is: orange  yellow  red  blue  table  shi  Let me plan the steps to achieve this goal:  1. First, [need to disassemble the current stack: - Unstack yellow from orange  - Put down yellow on table  - Unstack orange from blue  - Put down orange on table  2. Then I need to build the new stack:  - Pick up red (which is on the table)  - Stack red on top of blue  - Pick up yellow (which we put on the table) - Stack yellow on top of red  - Pick up orange (which we put on the table) - Stack orange on top of yellow  Let me double-check this plan against the constraints:  For step 1 (dismantling): - Yellow is clear initially, so we can unstack it from orange \f"

He also mentions concerns about the impact of his smoking on his family, particularly his wife. He does not see his smoking as a major problem, but rather as a habit he has had all his life.  Objective: Client appears resistant and defensive, with a tone of frustration and anger. He maintains a somewhat confrontational demeanor, but also shows signs of vulnerability and concern for his relationship with his wife.  assessment: Based on the client's report and observable behavior, it appears that he is struggling with feelings of resentment and anger towards his wife and children, who he feels are pressuring him to quit smoking. He also seems to be motivated by a desire to maintain his relationship with his wife and avoid conflict. It is likely that he is experiencing some ambivalence about quitting smoking, and may benefit from a gradual approach to cessation. Plan: Short-term goals include exploring the client’s motivations and concerns about quitting smoking, and developing a gradual plan for cessation. It may be helpful to involve the client's wife in future sessions to address her concerns and provide a unified approach to supporting the client’s quit attempt. Long-term goals include reducing the client’s symptoms of anger and frustration, improving his relationship with his wife and children, and increasing his overall well-being. \f"

HgO, 2, 30, or 40 min  Remarks  Sulfuric acid concentration in ethanol ranged from 0.2 to 4.0 M; various morphologies like stripes were obtained; corrosion was competing with anodizing.  Both acidic and alkaline electrolytes were applied. Nanostructured oxide was formed when NaOH was applied as an electrolyte.  The nanowires were made of amorphous precursors, such as Zn5(OH)¢(CO3)2. Annealing allowed the formation of crystalline ZnO. Carbonates were involved in the formation of the nanowires.  After anodizing, samples were annealed at temperatures ranging from 100 to 300 °C for 2 h; high-aspect-ratio nanowires were obtained as long as 20 um with diameters ranging from 100 to 200 nm. The band gap of the obtained wurtzite nanowires ranged from 3.20 to 3.23 eV.  Samples after anodizing were annealed in the air, 200 °C, 2 h; the longer the anodization time, the more densely packed the nanowires.  Annealing at 100-400 °C was performed; Raman spectra were recorded.  Annealing at 350 °C for 1 h was performed; UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were recorded.  Oxide with a highly developed surface area was obtained, but not made of nanowires.  Annealing at 400 °C for 70 min was performed; various concentrations of sodium and potassium bicarbonates were applied.  ZnCO3-H2O or Zn(HCO3)(OH) is formed on the Zn surface during anodizing.  Samples after anodizing were annealed in the air, 300 °C, 1 h; efficient photocatalyst for methylene blue decomposition, up to 87.3%  Some of the samples were annealed in the air at 200 °C; the mechanism of growth involves the formation of Zn(OH),47~ as an intermediate; the Incident Photon to Current Efficiency exceeded 16% for the optimized samples.  Three-electrode system with a potentiostat was applied; Zn/ ZnO served as the anode in high-capacity batteries.  Reference  [90]  [91]  [92]  [76]  [93]  [50] \f"

Both CuO and ZnO were detected by XRD  The impact of the passivation potential on the morphology of the formed passive oxides was investigated; photodegradation of methyl orange was performed  In the study, the impact of the glycerol on the morphology and composition of the grown nanostructured passive films was investigated; the erown nanostructures were used as a cathode in the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction, and it was revealed that the best samples are the ones obtained in 1.0 M NaOH without additives  Cu, CuAgjo, and Cug3Zn37 were oxidized using a potentiostat; the samples were examined before and after the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction to compare systematically the chemical composition and morphology before and after the reaction  Cu-Zn anodization was used to increase the surface area of deposited NiO; developed morphology  Depending on the applied potential, different morphologies were obtained; anodized brass lowered the onset potential for methanol electrooxidation (1.0 M KOH + 1.0 M CH308H); based on EIS, also charge transfer resistance was low for the anodized samples  Reference  [99]  [100]  [101]  [102]  [103]  [104]  [85]  [105]  [106] \f"

            "Lherapist (iuman) written note  Subjective: Client is a male who is presenting to therapy for smoking. Client reports his wife quit smoking around six months ago due to being ona health kick. Client reports he feels pressured to quit smoking by his wife. Client reports his wife is worried about his health and continuously saves articles about the negative effects of smoking and secondhand smoke. In addition, he feels pressure as his children feel negatively about his smoking as well. Client stated \"we used to go out and have a cigarette together at the table. Now I have to go outside in this weather. \" Client reports feeling upset due to being forced to change his lifestyle habits. Client also feels torn as he enjoys smoking but does not want to lose his family over it. Client inquired about his wife possibly attending his next session.  Objective: Client expressed frustration, anger, and reports feeling isolated due to his smoking. Client reports his smoking is impacting his family life and his physical health.  Assessment: Client appears to be in the contemplation stage of change. Although client is upset regarding his cigarette smoking, he appears to see the consequences of his smoking. In addition, he also appears to have an understanding of consequences regarding losing his family if he continued to smoke.  Plan: Client will follow up with wife to see her schedule in the hopes that she can attend next session with him. Client will also work on reducing his cigarette use.  Note generated by Llama 3.1 (70B)  Subjective: Client reports being forced to attend therapy by his wife due to her concerns about his smoking. He expresses feelings of anger, frustration, and resentment towards his wife and children, who he feels are ganging up on him. He also mentions concerns about the impact of his smoking on his family, particularly his wife. He does not see his smoking as a major problem, but rather as a habit he has had all his life.  Objective: Client appears resistant and defensive, with a tone of frustration and anger. He maintains a somewhat confrontational demeanor, but also shows signs of vulnerability and concern for his relationship with his wife.  assessment: Based on the client's report and observable behavior, it appears that he is struggling with feelings of resentment and anger towards his wife and children, who he feels are pressuring him to quit smoking. He also seems to be motivated by a desire to maintain his relationship with his wife and avoid conflict. It is likely that he is experiencing some ambivalence about quitting smoking, and may benefit from a gradual approach to cessation. Plan: Short-term goals include exploring the client’s motivations and concerns about quitting smoking, and developing a gradual plan for cessation. It may be helpful to involve the client's wife in future sessions to address her concerns and provide a unified approach to supporting the client’s quit attempt. Long-term goals include reducing the client’s symptoms of anger and frustration, improving his relationship with his wife and children, and increasing his overall well-being. \f"
