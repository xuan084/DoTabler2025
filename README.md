## DoTabler

This project provides the resources for the **DoTabler** system implementation, including core algorithm codes, trained models, and supporting analytical datasets. The detailed composition is as follows:



#### 1. Datasets (`./dataset/`)

* Doculent Laryout-Analyzied Subfigures (`./dataset/split_subfigures`)

  A processed dataset generated throught document layout analysis techniques, containing semantically segmented page components from original PDFs.

* Benchmark Annotation File (`./dataset/benchmark_dataset.xlsx`)

  Annotations include key dimensions:

  1. PDF_Name: Denoting the PDF file name
  2. Item_Subfigure: Identifier for the subfigure region containing tables
  3. Page: Source document page number of the corresponding table
  4. Related_Paragraphs: Descriptive text paragraphs sematically associated with the target table

  * Filename encoding convention: Embeds bounding box coordinates generated by document layout analysis

  This file constitues the manual annotation set for the Table-Centric Semantic Structure Parsing task

* Dataset used for RQ3 analysis (`./dataset/rq3_dataset/`)

  This dataset is constructed from RQ3 analysis.



#### 2. Experimental Analysis Scripts (`./`)

* `rq1_dotabler_model_comparison.py`: Corresponds tp the experimental analysis for **RQ1**.
* `rq2_analysis.py`: Pertains to **RQ2**.
* `rq3_analysis.py`: Addresses **RQ3**



#### 3. Trained Models (`./models/`)

This directory contains the core **Table-Text Association Model (TTAM)**, a semantic-level table-text relation analysis model fine-tuned on the RoBERTa-base architecture, saved as `block_relation_model_roberta-base_notitle.pth`.



#### 4. Execution Environment

The execution environment is denoted by `./requirements.txt`.
